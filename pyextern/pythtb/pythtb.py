class tb_model(object):
    r"""
    This is the main class of the PythTB package which contains all
    information for the tight-binding model.

    :param dim_k: Dimensionality of reciprocal space, i.e., specifies how
      many directions are considered to be periodic.

    :param dim_r: Dimensionality of real space, i.e., specifies how many
      real space lattice vectors there are and how many coordinates are
      needed to specify the orbital coordinates.
    .. note:: Parameter *dim_r* can be larger than *dim_k*! For example,
      a polymer is a three-dimensional molecule (one needs three
      coordinates to specify orbital positions), but it is periodic
      along only one direction. For a polymer, therefore, we should
      have *dim_k* equal to 1 and *dim_r* equal to 3. See similar example
      here: :ref:`trestle-example`.

    :param lat: Array containing lattice vectors in Cartesian
      coordinates (in arbitrary units). In example the below, the first
      lattice vector has coordinates [1.0,0.5] while the second
      one has coordinates [0.0,2.0].  By default, lattice vectors
      are an identity matrix.

    :param orb: Array containing reduced coordinates of all
      tight-binding orbitals. In the example below, the first
      orbital is defined with reduced coordinates [0.2,0.3]. Its
      Cartesian coordinates are therefore 0.2 times the first
      lattice vector plus 0.3 times the second lattice vector.
      If *orb* is an integer code will assume that there are these many
      orbitals all at the origin of the unit cell.  By default
      the code will assume a single orbital at the origin.

    :param per: This is an optional parameter giving a list of lattice
      vectors which are considered to be periodic. In the example below,
      only the vector [0.0,2.0] is considered to be periodic (since
      per=[1]). By default, all lattice vectors are assumed to be
      periodic. If dim_k is smaller than dim_r, then by default the first
      dim_k vectors are considered to be periodic.

    :param nspin: Number of explicit spin components assumed for each
      orbital in *orb*. Allowed values of *nspin* are *1* and *2*. If
      *nspin* is 1 then the model is spinless, if *nspin* is 2 then it
      is explicitly a spinfull model and each orbital is assumed to
      have two spin components. Default value of this parameter is
      *1*.  Of course one can make spinfull calculation even with
      *nspin* set to 1, but then the user must keep track of which
      orbital corresponds to which spin component.

    Example usage::

       # Creates model that is two-dimensional in real space but only
       # one-dimensional in reciprocal space. Second lattice vector is
       # chosen to be periodic (since per=[1]). Three orbital
       # coordinates are specified.
       tb = tb_model(1, 2,
                   lat=[[1.0, 0.5], [0.0, 2.0]],
                   orb=[[0.2, 0.3], [0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.2]],
                   per=[1])

        r"""
        Defines on-site energies for tight-binding orbitals. One can
        either set energy for one tight-binding orbital, or all at
        once.

        .. warning:: In previous version of PythTB this function was
          called *set_sites*. For backwards compatibility one can still
          use that name but that feature will be removed in future
          releases.

        :param onsite_en: Either a list of on-site energies (in
          arbitrary units) for each orbital, or a single on-site
          energy (in this case *ind_i* parameter must be given). In
          the case when *nspin* is *1* (spinless) then each on-site
          energy is a single number.  If *nspin* is *2* then on-site
          energy can be given either as a single number, or as an
          array of four numbers, or 2x2 matrix. If a single number is
          given, it is interpreted as on-site energy for both up and
          down spin component. If an array of four numbers is given,
          these are the coefficients of I, sigma_x, sigma_y, and
          sigma_z (that is, the 2x2 identity and the three Pauli spin
          matrices) respectively. Finally, full 2x2 matrix can be
          given as well. If this function is never called, on-site
          energy is assumed to be zero.

        :param ind_i: Index of tight-binding orbital whose on-site
          energy you wish to change. This parameter should be
          specified only when *onsite_en* is a single number (not a
          list).

        :param mode: Similar to parameter *mode* in function set_hop*.
          Speficies way in which parameter *onsite_en* is
          used. It can either set value of on-site energy from scratch,
          reset it, or add to it.

          * "set" -- Default value. On-site energy is set to value of
            *onsite_en* parameter. One can use "set" on each
            tight-binding orbital only once.

          * "reset" -- Specifies on-site energy to given value. This
            function can be called multiple times for the same
            orbital(s).

          * "add" -- Adds to the previous value of on-site
            energy. This function can be called multiple times for the
            same orbital(s).

        Example usage::

          # Defines on-site energy of first orbital to be 0.0,
          # second 1.0, and third 2.0
          tb.set_onsite([0.0, 1.0, 2.0])

          tb.set_onsite(100.0, 1, mode="add")
          # Changes on-site energy of second orbital to zero
          tb.set_onsite(0.0, 1, mode="reset")
          # Sets all three on-site energies at once

        Defines hopping parameters between tight-binding orbitals. In
        the notation used in section 3.1 equation 3.6 of
        :download:`notes on tight-binding formalism
        <misc/pythtb-formalism.pdf>` this function specifies the

          H_{ij}({\bf R})= \langle \phi_{{\bf 0} i}  \vert H  \vert \phi_{{\bf R},j} \rangle

        Where :math:`\langle \phi_{{\bf 0} i} \vert` is i-th
        tight-binding orbital in the home unit cell and
        :math:`\vert \phi_{{\bf R},j} \rangle` is j-th tight-binding orbital in
        unit cell shifted by lattice vector :math:`{\bf R}`. :math:`H`
        is the Hamiltonian.

        (Strictly speaking, this term specifies hopping amplitude
        for hopping from site *j+R* to site *i*, not vice-versa.)

        Hopping in the opposite direction is automatically included by

           \rightarrow i-R` direction since that is done
           automatically. If you want to specifiy hoppings in both
           directions, see description of parameter
           *allow_conjugate_pair*.

        .. warning:: In previous version of PythTB this function was
          called *add_hop*. For backwards compatibility one can still
          use that name but that feature will be removed in future
          releases.

        :param hop_amp: Hopping amplitude; can be real or complex
          number, equals :math:`H_{ij}({\bf R})`. If *nspin* is *2*
          then hopping amplitude can be given either as a single
          number, or as an array of four numbers, or as 2x2 matrix. If
          a single number is given, it is interpreted as hopping
          amplitude for both up and down spin component.  If an array
          of four numbers is given, these are the coefficients of I,
          sigma_x, sigma_y, and sigma_z (that is, the 2x2 identity and
          the three Pauli spin matrices) respectively. Finally, full
          2x2 matrix can be given as well.

        :param ind_i: Index of bra orbital from the bracket :math:`\langle
          \phi_{{\bf 0} i} \vert H \vert \phi_{{\bf R},j} \rangle`. This
          orbital is assumed to be in the home unit cell.

        :param ind_j: Index of ket orbital from the bracket :math:`\langle
          \phi_{{\bf 0} i} \vert H \vert \phi_{{\bf R},j} \rangle`. This
          orbital does not have to be in the home unit cell; its unit cell
          position is determined by parameter *ind_R*.

        :param ind_R: Specifies, in reduced coordinates, the shift of
          the ket orbital. The number of coordinates must equal the
          dimensionality in real space (*dim_r* parameter) for consistency,
          but only the periodic directions of ind_R will be considered. If
          reciprocal space is zero-dimensional (as in a molecule),
          this parameter does not need to be specified.

        :param mode: Similar to parameter *mode* in function *set_onsite*.
          Speficies way in which parameter *hop_amp* is
          used. It can either set value of hopping term from scratch,
          reset it, or add to it.

          * "set" -- Default value. Hopping term is set to value of
            *hop_amp* parameter. One can use "set" for each triplet of
            *ind_i*, *ind_j*, *ind_R* only once.

          * "reset" -- Specifies on-site energy to given value. This
            function can be called multiple times for the same triplet
            *ind_i*, *ind_j*, *ind_R*.

            function can be called multiple times for the same triplet
            *ind_i*, *ind_j*, *ind_R*.

          If *set_hop* was ever called with *allow_conjugate_pair* set
          to True, then it is possible that user has specified both
          :math:`i \rightarrow j+R` and conjugate pair :math:`j
          \rightarrow i-R`.  In this case, "set", "reset", and "add"
          parameters will treat triplet *ind_i*, *ind_j*, *ind_R* and
          conjugate triplet *ind_j*, *ind_i*, *-ind_R* as distinct.

        :param allow_conjugate_pair: Default value is *False*. If set

        r"""

        Rudimentary function for visualizing tight-binding model geometry,
        hopping between tight-binding orbitals, and electron eigenstates.

        If eigenvector is not drawn, then orbitals in home cell are drawn
        as red circles, and those in neighboring cells are drawn with
        different shade of red. Hopping term directions are drawn with
        green lines connecting two orbitals. Origin of unit cell is
        indicated with blue dot, while real space unit vectors are drawn
        with blue lines.

        If eigenvector is drawn, then electron eigenstate on each orbital
        is drawn with a circle whose size is proportional to wavefunction
        amplitude while its color depends on the phase. There are various
        coloring schemes for the phase factor; see more details under
        *ph_color* parameter. If eigenvector is drawn and coloring scheme
        is "red-blue" or "wheel", all other elements of the picture are
        drawn in gray or black.

        :param dir_first: First index of Cartesian coordinates used for
          plotting.

        :param dir_second: Second index of Cartesian coordinates used for
          plotting. For example if dir_first=0 and dir_second=2, and
          Cartesian coordinates of some orbital is [2.0,4.0,6.0] then it
          will be drawn at coordinate [2.0,6.0]. If dimensionality of real
          space (*dim_r*) is zero or one then dir_second should not be
          specified.

        :param eig_dr: Optional parameter specifying eigenstate to
          plot. If specified, this should be one-dimensional array of
          complex numbers specifying wavefunction at each orbital in
          the tight-binding basis. If not specified, eigenstate is not
          drawn.

        :param draw_hoppings: Optional parameter specifying whether to
          draw all allowed hopping terms in the tight-binding
          model. Default value is True.

        :param ph_color: Optional parameter determining the way
          eigenvector phase factors are translated into color. Default
          value is "black". Convention of the wavefunction phase is as
          in convention 1 in section 3.1 of :download:`notes on
          tight-binding formalism  <misc/pythtb-formalism.pdf>`.  In
          other words, these wavefunction phases are in correspondence
          with cell-periodic functions :math:`u_{n {\bf k}} ({\bf r})`
          not :math:`\Psi_{n {\bf k}} ({\bf r})`.

          * "black" -- phase of eigenvectors are ignored and wavefunction
            is always colored in black.

          * "red-blue" -- zero phase is drawn red, while phases or pi or
            -pi are drawn blue. Phases in between are interpolated between
            red and blue. Some phase information is lost in this coloring
            becase phase of +phi and -phi have same color.

          * "wheel" -- each phase is given unique color. In steps of pi/3
            starting from 0, colors are assigned (in increasing hue) as:
            red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, red.

        :returns:
          * **fig** -- Figure object from matplotlib.pyplot module
            that can be used to save the figure in PDF, EPS or similar
            format, for example using fig.savefig("name.pdf") command.
          * **ax** -- Axes object from matplotlib.pyplot module that can be
            used to tweak the plot, for example by adding a plot title
            ax.set_title("Title goes here").

        Example usage::

          # Draws x-y projection of tight-binding model
          # tweaks figure and saves it as a PDF.

        Solves for eigenvalues and (optionally) eigenvectors of the

        .. note::

           Eigenvectors (wavefunctions) returned by this
           function and used throughout the code are exclusively given
           in convention 1 as described in section 3.1 of
           :download:`notes on tight-binding formalism
           <misc/pythtb-formalism.pdf>`.  In other words, they
           are in correspondence with cell-periodic functions
           :math:`u_{n {\bf k}} ({\bf r})` not
           :math:`\Psi_{n {\bf k}} ({\bf r})`.

        .. note::

           In some cases class :class:`pythtb.wf_array` provides a more
           elegant way to deal with eigensolutions on a regular mesh of
           k-vectors.

        :param k_list: One-dimensional array of k-vectors. Each k-vector
          is given in reduced coordinates of the reciprocal space unit
          cell. For example, for real space unit cell vectors [1.0,0.0]
          and [0.0,2.0] and associated reciprocal space unit vectors
          [2.0*pi,0.0] and [0.0,pi], k-vector with reduced coordinates
          [0.25,0.25] corresponds to k-vector [0.5*pi,0.25*pi].
          Dimensionality of each vector must equal to the number of
          periodic directions (i.e. dimensionality of reciprocal space,
          *dim_k*).
          This parameter shouldn't be specified for system with
          zero-dimensional k-space (*dim_k* =0).

        :param eig_vectors: Optional boolean parameter, specifying whether
          eigenvectors should be returned. If *eig_vectors* is True, then
          both eigenvalues and eigenvectors are returned, otherwise only
          eigenvalues are returned.

        :returns:
          * **eval** -- Two dimensional array of eigenvalues for
            all bands for all kpoints. Format is eval[band,kpoint] where
            first index (band) corresponds to the electron band in
            question and second index (kpoint) corresponds to the k-point
            as listed in the input parameter *k_list*. Eigenvalues are
            sorted from smallest to largest at each k-point seperately.

            In the case when reciprocal space is zero-dimensional (as in a
            molecule) kpoint index is dropped and *eval* is of the format
            eval[band].

          * **evec** -- Three dimensional array of eigenvectors for
            all bands and all kpoints. If *nspin* equals 1 the format
            of *evec* is evec[band,kpoint,orbital] where "band" is the
            electron band in question, "kpoint" is index of k-vector
            as given in input parameter *k_list*. Finally, "orbital"
            refers to the tight-binding orbital basis function.
            Ordering of bands is the same as in *eval*.

            Eigenvectors evec[n,k,j] correspond to :math:`C^{n {\bf
            k}}_{j}` from section 3.1 equation 3.5 and 3.7 of the
            :download:`notes on tight-binding formalism
            <misc/pythtb-formalism.pdf>`.

            In the case when reciprocal space is zero-dimensional (as in a
            molecule) kpoint index is dropped and *evec* is of the format
            evec[band,orbital].

            In the spinfull calculation (*nspin* equals 2) evec has
            additional component evec[...,spin] corresponding to the
            spin component of the wavefunction.

    def k_path(self,kpts,nk,report=True):
        r"""

        Interpolates a path in reciprocal space between specified
        k-points.  In 2D or 3D the k-path can consist of several
        straight segments connecting high-symmetry points ("nodes"),
        and the results can be used to plot the bands along this path.

        The interpolated path that is returned contains as
        equidistant k-points as possible.

        :param kpts: Array of k-vectors in reciprocal space between
          which interpolated path should be constructed. These
          k-vectors must be given in reduced coordinates.  As a

          * *"full"*  -- Implies  *[ 0.0, 0.5, 1.0]*  (full BZ)

          * *"half"*  -- Implies  *[ 0.0, 0.5]*  (half BZ)

          is desired (default is True).

            k-points. The distance between the points is calculated in
            the Cartesian frame, however coordinates themselves are
            given in dimensionless reduced coordinates!  This is done

            k-point in the path.  Unlike array *k_vec* this one has
            dimensions! (Units are defined here so that for an
            one-dimensional crystal with lattice constant equal to for
            example *10* the length of the Brillouin zone would equal
            *1/10=0.1*.  In other words factors of :math:`2\pi` are
            absorbed into *k*.) This array can be used to plot path in
            the k-space so that the distances between the k-points in
            the plot are exact.

          this function will return not only eigenvalues but also

        :param basis: Optional parameter. If basis="bloch" then hybrid
          Wannier function *hwf_evec* is written in the Bloch basis.  I.e.
          hwf[i,j] correspond to the weight of j-th Bloch state from *evec*
          in the i-th hybrid Wannier function.  If basis="orbital" and nspin=1 then
          hwf[i,orb] correspond to the weight of orb-th orbital in the i-th
          hybrid Wannier function.  If basis="orbital" and nspin=2 then
          hwf[i,orb,spin] correspond to the weight of orb-th orbital, spin-th

          * **hwf** -- Eigenvectors of the position operator matrix :math:`X`.
            (also called hybrid Wannier functions).  These are returned only if
            parameter *hwf_evec* is set to *True*.
            The shape of this array is [h,x] or [h,x,s] depending on value of *basis*
            and *nspin*.  If *basis* is "bloch" then x refers to indices of
            Bloch states *evec*.  If *basis* is "orbital" then *x* (or *x* and *s*)

class wf_array(object):
    r"""

    This class is used to solve a tight-binding model
    :class:`pythtb.tb_model` on a regular or non-regular grid
    of points in reciprocal space and/or parameter space, and
    perform on it various calculations. For example it can be
    used to calculate the Berry phase, Berry curvature, 1st Chern
    number, etc.

    *Regular k-space grid*:
    If the grid is a regular k-mesh (no parametric dimensions),
    a single call to the function
    :func:`pythtb.wf_array.solve_on_grid` will both construct a
    k-mesh that uniformly covers the Brillouin zone, and populate
    it with wavefunctions (eigenvectors) computed on this grid.
    The last point in each k-dimension is set so that it represents
    the same Bloch function as the first one (this involves the
    insertion of some orbital-position-dependent phase factors).

    Example :ref:`haldane_bp-example` shows how to use wf_array on
    a regular grid of points in k-space. Examples :ref:`cone-example`
    and :ref:`3site_cycle-example` show how to use non-regular grid of
    points.

    *Parametric or irregular k-space grid grid*:
    An irregular grid of points, or a grid that includes also
    one or more parametric dimensions, can be populated manually
    with the help of the *[]* operator.  For example, to copy
    eigenvectors *evec* into coordinate (2,3) in the *wf_array*
    object *wf* one can simply do::

      wf[2,3]=evec

    The eigenvectors (wavefunctions) *evec* in the example above
    are expected to be in the format *evec[band,orbital]*
    (or *evec[band,orbital,spin]* for the spinfull calculation).
    This is the same format as returned by
    :func:`pythtb.tb_model.solve_one` or
    :func:`pythtb.tb_model.solve_all` (in the latter case one
    needs to restrict it to a single k-point as *evec[:,kpt,:]*
    if the model has *dim_k>=1*).

    If wf_array is used for closed paths, either in a
    reciprocal-space or parametric direction, then one needs to
    include both the starting and ending eigenfunctions even though
    they are physically equivalent.  If the array dimension in
    question is a k-vector direction and the path traverses the
    Brillouin zone in a primitive reciprocal-lattice direction,
    :func:`pythtb.wf_array.impose_pbc` can be used to associate
    the starting and ending points with each other; if it is a
    non-winding loop in k-space or a loop in parameter space,
    then :func:`pythtb.wf_array.impose_loop` can be used instead.
    (These may not be necessary if only Berry fluxes are needed.)

    Example :ref:`3site_cycle-example` shows how one
    of the directions of *wf_array* object need not be a k-vector
    direction, but can instead be a Hamiltonian parameter :math:`\lambda`
    (see also discussion after equation 4.1 in :download:`notes on
    tight-binding formalism <misc/pythtb-formalism.pdf>`).

    :param model: Object of type :class:`pythtb.tb_model` representing
      tight-binding model associated with this array of eigenvectors.

    :param mesh_arr: Array giving a dimension of the grid of points in
      each reciprocal-space or parametric direction.

    Example usage::

      # Construct wf_array capable of storing an 11x21 array of
      # wavefunctions
      wf = wf_array(tb, [11, 21])
      # populate this wf_array with regular grid of points in
      # Brillouin zone
      wf.solve_on_grid([0.0, 0.0])

      # Compute set of eigenvectors at one k-point
      (eval, evec) = tb.solve_one([kx, ky], eig_vectors = True)
      # Store it manually into a specified location in the array

        the code.

        The eigenfunctions :math:`\Psi_{n {\bf k}}` are by convention
        chosen to obey a periodic gauge, i.e.,
        :math:`\Psi_{n,{\bf k+G}}=\Psi_{n {\bf k}}` not only up to a
        phase, but they are also equal in phase.  It follows that
        the cell-periodic Bloch functions are related by
        :math:`u_{n,{\bf k+G}}=e^{-i{\bf G}\cdot{\bf r}} u_{n {\bf k}}`.
        See :download:`notes on tight-binding formalism

        to this formula, overwriting the previous value.

        This function will impose these periodic boundary conditions along
        one direction of the array. We are assuming that the k-point
        mesh increases by exactly one reciprocal lattice vector along
        this direction. This is currently **not** checked by the code;
        it is the responsibility of the user. Currently *wf_array*

        it only stores the eigenvectors (wavefunctions).

    def berry_phase(self,occ,dir=None,contin=True,berry_evals=False):
        r"""

        Computes the Berry phase along a given array direction and
        for a given set of occupied states.  This assumes that the
        occupied bands are well separated in energy from unoccupied
        bands. It is the responsibility of the user to check that
        this is satisfied.  By default, the Berry phase traced over
        occupied bands is returned, but optionally the individual
        phases of the eigenvalues of the global unitary rotation
        matrix (corresponding to "maximally localized Wannier
        centers" or "Wilson loop eigenvalues") can be requested
        (see parameter *berry_evals* for more details).

        For an array of size *N* in direction $dir$, the Berry phase
        is computed from the *N-1* inner products of neighboring
        eigenfunctions.  This corresponds to an "open-path Berry
        phase" if the first and last points have no special
        relation.  If they correspond to the same physical
        Hamiltonian, and have been properly aligned in phase using
        :func:`pythtb.wf_array.impose_pbc` or
        :func:`pythtb.wf_array.impose_loop`, then a closed-path
        Berry phase will be computed.

        For a one-dimensional wf_array (i.e., a single string), the
        computed Berry phases are always chosen to be between -pi and pi.
        For a higher dimensional wf_array, the Berry phase is computed
        for each one-dimensional string of points, and an array of
        Berry phases is returned. The Berry phase for the first string
        (with lowest index) is always constrained to be between -pi and
        pi. The range of the remaining phases depends on the value of
        the input parameter *contin*.

        The discretized formula used to compute Berry phase is described
        in Sec. 4.5 of :download:`notes on tight-binding formalism
        <misc/pythtb-formalism.pdf>`.

        :param occ: Array of indices of energy bands which are considered
          to be occupied.

        :param dir: Index of wf_array direction along which Berry phase is
          computed. This parameters needs not be specified for
          a one-dimensional wf_array.

        :param contin: Optional boolean parameter. If True then the
          branch choice of the Berry phase (which is indeterminate
          modulo 2*pi) is made so that neighboring strings (in the
          direction of increasing index value) have as close as
          possible phases. The phase of the first string (with lowest
          index) is always constrained to be between -pi and pi. If
          False, the Berry phase for every string is constrained to be
          between -pi and pi. The default value is True.

        :param berry_evals: Optional boolean parameter. If True then
          will compute and return the phases of the eigenvalues of the
          product of overlap matrices. (These numbers correspond also
          to hybrid Wannier function centers.) These phases are either
          forced to be between -pi and pi (if *contin* is *False*) or
          they are made to be continuous (if *contin* is True).

        :returns:
          * **pha** -- If *berry_evals* is False (default value) then
            returns the Berry phase for each string. For a
            one-dimensional wf_array this is just one number. For a
            higher-dimensional wf_array *pha* contains one phase for
            each one-dimensional string in the following format. For
            example, if *wf_array* contains k-points on mesh with
            indices [i,j,k] and if direction along which Berry phase
            is computed is *dir=1* then *pha* will be two dimensional
            array with indices [i,k], since Berry phase is computed
            along second direction. If *berry_evals* is True then for
            each string returns phases of all eigenvalues of the
            product of overlap matrices. In the convention used for
            previous example, *pha* in this case would have indices
            [i,k,n] where *n* refers to index of individual phase of
            the product matrix eigenvalue.

        Example usage::

          # Computes Berry phases along second direction for three lowest
          # occupied states. For example, if wf is threedimensional, then
          # pha[2,3] would correspond to Berry phase of string of states
          # along wf[2,:,3]
          pha = wf.berry_phase([0, 1, 2], 1)

class w90(object):
    r"""

    This class of the PythTB package imports tight-binding model
    parameters from an output of a `Wannier90
    <http://www.wannier.org>`_ code.

    The `Wannier90 <http://www.wannier.org>`_ code is a
    post-processing tool that takes as an input electron wavefunctions
    and energies computed from first-principles using any of the
    following codes: Quantum-Espresso (PWscf), AbInit, SIESTA, FLEUR,
    Wien2k, VASP.  As an output Wannier90 will create files that
    contain parameters for a tight-binding model that exactly
    reproduces the first-principles calculated electron band
    structure.

    The interface from Wannier90 to PythTB will use only the following
    files created by Wannier90:

    - *prefix*.win
    - *prefix*\_hr.dat
    - *prefix*\_centres.xyz
    - *prefix*\_band.kpt (optional)
    - *prefix*\_band.dat (optional)

    The first file (*prefix*.win) is an input file to Wannier90 itself. This
    file is needed so that PythTB can read in the unit cell vectors.

    To correctly create the second and the third file (*prefix*\_hr.dat and
    *prefix*\_centres.dat) one needs to include the following flags in the win
    file::

       hr_plot = True
       write_xyz = True
       translate_home_cell = False

    These lines ensure that *prefix*\_hr.dat and *prefix*\_centres.dat
    are written and that the centers of the Wannier functions written
    in the *prefix*\_centres.dat file are not translated to the home
    cell.  The *prefix*\_hr.dat file contains the onsite and hopping
    terms.

    The final two files (*prefix*\_band.kpt and *prefix*\_band.dat)
    are optional.  Please see documentation of function
    :func:`pythtb.w90.w90_bands_consistency` for more detail.

    So far we tested only Wannier90 version 2.0.1.

    .. warning:: For the time being PythTB is not optimized to be used
      with very large tight-binding models.  Therefore it is not
      advisable to use the interface to Wannier90 with large
      first-principles calculations that contain many k-points and/or
      electron bands.  One way to reduce the computational cost is to
      wannierize with Wannier90 only the bands of interest (for
      example, bands near the Fermi level).

    Units used throught this interface with Wannier90 are
    electron-volts (eV) and Angstroms.

    .. warning:: User needs to make sure that the Wannier functions
      computed using Wannier90 code are well localized.  Otherwise the
      tight-binding model might not interpolate well the band
      structure.  To ensure that the Wannier functions are well
      localized it is often enough to check that the total spread at
      the beginning of the minimization procedure (first total spread
      printed in .wout file) is not more than 20% larger than the
      total spread at the end of the minimization procedure.  If those
      spreads differ by much more than 20% user needs to specify
      better initial projection functions.

      In addition, please note that the interpolation is valid only
      within the frozen energy window of the disentanglement
      procedure.

    .. warning:: So far PythTB assumes that the position operator is
      diagonal in the tight-binding basis.  This is discussed in the
      :download:`notes on tight-binding formalism
      <misc/pythtb-formalism.pdf>` in Eq. 2.7.,
      :math:`\langle\phi_{{\bf R} i} \vert {\bf r} \vert \phi_{{\bf
      R}' j} \rangle = ({\bf R} + {\bf t}_j) \delta_{{\bf R} {\bf R}'}
      \delta_{ij}`.  However, this relation does not hold for Wannier
      functions!  Therefore, if you use tight-binding model derived
      from this class in computing Berry-like objects that involve
      position operator such as Berry phase or Berry flux, you would
      not get the same result as if you computed those objects
      directly from the first-principles code!  Nevertheless, this
      approximation does not affect other properties such as band
      structure dispersion.

    For the testing purposes user can download the following
    :download:`wannier90 output example
    <misc/wannier90_example.tar.gz>` and use the following
    :ref:`script <w90_quick>` to test the functionality of the interface to
    PythTB. Run the following command in unix terminal to decompress
    the tarball::

        tar -zxf wannier90_example.tar.gz

    and then run the following :ref:`script <w90_quick>` in the same
    folder.

    :param path: Relative path to the folder that contains Wannier90
       files.  These are *prefix*.win, *prefix*\_hr.dat,
       *prefix*\_centres.dat and optionally *prefix*\_band.kpt and
       *prefix*\_band.dat.

    :param prefix: This is the prefix used by Wannier90 code.
        Typically the input to the Wannier90 code is name *prefix*.win.

    Initially this function will read in the entire Wannier90 output.
    To create :class:`pythtb.tb_model` object user needs to call
    :func:`pythtb.w90.model`.

    Example usage::

      # reads Wannier90 from folder called *example_a*
      # it assumes that that folder contains files "silicon.win" and so on
      silicon=w90("example_a", "silicon")

        This function returns :class:`pythtb.tb_model` object that can
        be used to interpolate the band structure at arbitrary
        k-point, analyze the wavefunction character, etc.

        The tight-binding basis orbitals in the returned object are
        maximally localized Wannier functions as computed by
        Wannier90.  The orbital character of these functions can be
        inferred either from the *projections* block in the
        *prefix*.win or from the *prefix*.nnkp file.  Please note that
        the character of the maximally localized Wannier functions is
        not exactly the same as that specified by the initial
        projections.  One way to ensure that the Wannier functions are
        as close to the initial projections as possible is to first
        choose a good set of initial projections (for these initial
        and final spread should not differ more than 20%) and then
        perform another Wannier90 run setting *num_iter=0* in the
        *prefix*.win file.

        Number of spin components is always set to 1, even if the
        underlying DFT calculation includes spin.  Please refer to the
        *projections* block or the *prefix*.nnkp file to see which
        orbitals correspond to which spin.

        Locations of the orbitals in the returned
        :class:`pythtb.tb_model` object are equal to the centers of
        the Wannier functions computed by Wannier90.

        :param zero_energy: Sets the zero of the energy in the band
          structure.  This value is typically set to the Fermi level
          computed by the density-functional code (or to the top of the
          valence band).  Units are electron-volts.

        :param min_hopping_norm: Hopping terms read from Wannier90 with
          complex norm less than *min_hopping_norm* will not be included
          in the returned tight-binding model.  This parameters is
          specified in electron-volts.  By default all terms regardless
          of their norm are included.

        :param max_distance: Hopping terms from site *i* to site *j+R* will
          be ignored if the distance from orbital *i* to *j+R* is larger
          than *max_distance*.  This parameter is given in Angstroms.
          By default all terms regardless of the distance are included.

        :param ignorable_imaginary_part: The hopping term will be assumed to
          be exactly real if the absolute value of the imaginary part as
          computed by Wannier90 is less than *ignorable_imaginary_part*.
          By default imaginary terms are not ignored.  Units are again

          * **kpts** -- k-points in reduced coordinates used in the
            interpolation in Wannier90 code.  The format of *kpts* is
            the same as the one used by the input to
            :func:`pythtb.tb_model.solve_all`.

          * **ene** -- energies interpolated by Wannier90 in
            eV. Format is ene[band,kpoint].

          # get band structure from wannier90
          (w90_kpt,w90_evals)=silicon.w90_bands_consistency()

          # get simplified model
          my_model_simple=silicon.model(min_hopping_norm=0.01)

          # solve simplified model on the same k-path as in wannier90
          evals=my_model.solve_all(w90_kpt)

  It looks like you are trying to calculate Berry-like object that
  involves position operator.  However, you are using a tight-binding
  model that was generated from Wannier90.  This procedure introduces
  approximation as it ignores off-diagonal elements of the position
  operator in the Wannier basis.  This is discussed here in more
  detail:

    http://physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/usage.html#pythtb.w90

  If you know what you are doing and wish to continue with the
  calculation despite this approximation, please call the following
  function on your tb_model object

    my_model.ignore_position_operator_offdiagonal()
